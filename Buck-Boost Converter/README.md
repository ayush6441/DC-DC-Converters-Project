## Brief Description of the Buck-Boost Converter
A **Buck-Boost Converter** is a type of DC-DC power converter that can either step up or step down the input voltage to provide a stable output voltage. It operates by controlling the energy stored in an inductor, which allows it to handle both situationsâ€”when the input voltage is higher or lower than the desired output voltage.

### Key Features:
- **Voltage Regulation:** Can step up or step down the input DC voltage to a required output voltage.  
- **Wide Applications:** Used in power supplies, battery management systems, and scenarios requiring both voltage increase and decrease.  

## Goals of the Project
1. Design a Buck-Boost converter circuit with theoretical calculations.  
2. Simulate the circuit to validate its operation under different conditions.  
3. Demonstrate the functionality of the hardware model and compare it with simulation results.  

## Repository Overview
This repository includes:
- **Detailed Project File:** Includes theoretical explanations, observations, and conclusions.  
- **Images:** Photos of the hardware model.  
- **MATLAB Simulations:** Simulation files and their screenshots.  
- **Schematic File:** Circuit schematic used for the hardware design.
