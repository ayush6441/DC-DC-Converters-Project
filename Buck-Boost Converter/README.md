# Buck-Boost Converter Project

This repository contains the design and simulation details for the **Buck-Boost Converter**.

## Brief Description of the Buck-Boost Converter
A **Buck-Boost Converter** is a type of DC-DC converter that can either step up or step down the input voltage to provide a stable output voltage. It works by controlling the energy stored in an inductor, enabling the converter to handle both situationsâ€”when the input voltage is higher or lower than the required output voltage.

This flexibility makes the Buck-Boost Converter highly useful in applications where the input voltage can vary above or below the desired output level. It is commonly used in battery-powered systems, voltage regulators, and other applications where a stable output is required regardless of input voltage fluctuations.

### Key Features:
- **Voltage Regulation:** Can step up or step down the input DC voltage to a required output voltage.
- **Dual Functionality:** Handles both voltage step-up and step-down operations with high efficiency.
- **Wide Applications:** Used in battery management systems, renewable energy systems, and other applications requiring stable output despite input variations.
