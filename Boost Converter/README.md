## Brief Description of the Boost Converter
A **Boost Converter** is a type of DC-DC power converter that steps up the input voltage to a higher output voltage. It operates using the principles of energy storage in an inductor during the "on" phase of a switch and energy transfer to the load during the "off" phase.

### Key Features:
- Voltage Step-Up: Converts a lower input DC voltage to a higher output DC voltage.  
- Wide Applications: Used in areas like renewable energy systems, portable electronics, and automotive systems.  

## Goals of the Project
1. Design a boost converter circuit with theoretical calculations.  
2. Simulate the circuit to validate its operation under different conditions.  
3. Demonstrate the functionality of the hardware model and compare it with simulation results.  

## Repository Overview
This repository includes:
- **Detailed Project File:** Includes theoretical explanations, observations, and conclusions.  
- **Images:** Photos of the hardware model.  
- **MATLAB Simulations:** Simulation files and their screenshots.  
- **Schematic File:** Circuit schematic used for the hardware design.
