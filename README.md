# DC-DC Converter Project #


This repository is a combination of three different DC-DC converter projects: **Boost Converter**, **Buck Converter**, and **Buck-Boost Converter**. These projects were developed as part of our academic curriculum to explore and understand the principles of power electronics.

## Repository Overview
This repository includes the designs, simulations, and hardware implementations for three types of DC-DC converters:
- **Boost Converter**: A converter that steps up the input voltage to a higher output voltage.
- **Buck Converter**: A converter that steps down the input voltage to a lower output voltage.
- **Buck-Boost Converter**: A converter that can either step up or step down the input voltage to provide a stable output voltage.

Each project includes:
- **Detailed Project File:** Includes theoretical explanations, observations, and conclusions for each converter.
- **Images:** Photos of the hardware models for each converter.
- **MATLAB Simulations:** Simulation files and their screenshots.
- **Schematic Files:** Circuit schematics used for the hardware designs.

Stay tuned for detailed updates and resources for each of the converters.
