## Brief Description of the Buck Converter
A **Buck Converter** is a type of DC-DC power converter that steps down the input voltage to a lower output voltage. It works by switching a transistor on and off, storing energy in an inductor during the "on" phase and releasing it during the "off" phase, thereby regulating the output voltage.

### Key Features:
- Voltage Step-Down: Converts a higher input DC voltage to a lower output DC voltage.  
- Wide Applications: Commonly used in power supplies for electronics, battery charging, and efficient voltage regulation.  

## Goals of the Project
1. Design a buck converter circuit with theoretical calculations.  
2. Simulate the circuit to validate its operation under different conditions.  
3. Demonstrate the functionality of the hardware model and compare it with simulation results.  

## Repository Overview
This repository includes:
- **Detailed Project File:** Includes theoretical explanations, observations, and conclusions.  
- **Images:** Photos of the hardware model.  
- **MATLAB Simulations:** Simulation files and their screenshots.  
- **Schematic File:** Circuit schematic used for the hardware design.
