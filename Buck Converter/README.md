# Buck Converter Project

This repository contains the design and simulation details for the **Buck Converter**.

## Brief Description of the Buck Converter
A **Buck Converter** is a type of DC-DC power converter that steps down the input voltage to a lower output voltage. It works by switching a transistor on and off, storing energy in an inductor during the "on" phase and releasing it during the "off" phase. This allows the converter to regulate the output voltage by maintaining a steady current.

Buck converters are widely used in applications like power supplies for electronics, battery chargers, and other systems requiring efficient voltage regulation. The main advantage of a Buck Converter is its high efficiency and ability to reduce the voltage without significant energy loss.

### Key Features:
- **Voltage Step-Down:** Converts a higher input DC voltage to a lower output DC voltage.
- **High Efficiency:** The switch-mode operation of the converter ensures minimal energy loss, making it highly efficient.
- **Application Range:** Commonly used in applications like powering LED lights, battery charging circuits, and various consumer electronics.
